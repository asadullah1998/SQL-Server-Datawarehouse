Online Retail Sales Data Engineering

Dataset: Obtain a sample online retail sales dataset with information about products, customers, and sales transactions.

Tasks:

Data Ingestion:
•	Implement a data ingestion process to fetch the dataset from its source (e.g., CSV file, database).
•	Load the dataset into a suitable storage system (e.g., relational database, data warehouse).
Data Cleaning and Validation:
•	Develop a data cleaning pipeline to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
•	Validate the integrity and consistency of the data during the cleaning process.
Data Transformation:
•	Transform the data into a structured format suitable for analytical processing.
•	Create a pipeline to convert relevant columns to appropriate data types.
•	Implement any necessary data standardization or normalization.
Data Warehouse Design:
•	Design and create a data warehouse schema to support efficient querying and reporting.
•	Define tables for products, customers, and sales transactions.
•	Establish appropriate relationships between tables.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process:
•	Build an ETL pipeline to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
•	Schedule the ETL process to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).
Partitioning and Indexing:
•	Implement partitioning and indexing strategies to optimize data retrieval performance.
•	Evaluate and choose suitable columns for partitioning and indexing.
Data Quality Monitoring:
•	Set up monitoring mechanisms to track data quality over time.
•	Establish alerts for anomalies or issues detected during the ETL process.
Data Versioning:
•	Implement a versioning system for the dataset to track changes and updates.
•	Archive previous versions of the dataset for historical analysis.
Metadata Management:
•	Create a metadata repository to document the structure and lineage of the dataset.
•	Include information on data sources, transformations, and storage locations.
Performance Optimization:
•	Optimize the performance of data retrieval queries by analysing query execution plans.
•	Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
Deliverables:
•	Python or SQL scripts for each step of the ETL process.
•	Documentation outlining the data warehouse schema, ETL pipeline, and data quality monitoring.
•	Recommendations for further optimizations and improvements.
